# LTI Tool — Express + Next.js

This project is a basic Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) 1.3 tool designed to work with major LMS platforms including Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, and D2L.

The application consists of a backend service that handles LTI authentication and platform communication, and a web-based UI that runs inside the LMS iframe after a successful launch.

This repository provides a starting point for building LTI-compliant educational tools with a modern web stack.

## Features

- LTI 1.3 + Advantage compatible
- Works across major LMS platforms
- Secure JWT-based launch flow
- LMS-embedded web UI
- Ready for extension with grading and roster services

## Status

This is an early-stage starter project intended for development and experimentation. Production hardening, monitoring, and scaling should be added before deployment to real institutions.
